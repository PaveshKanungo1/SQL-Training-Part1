* History and evolution of databases
  1960s: Computerized Database usage started (Flat Files)
  1970s: Relational Databases usage started
  Then development of non-relational databases, cloud-based solutions, and distributed systems to meet diverse and complex data needs
  
* Types of Databases
  - Relational Databases: Store data in structured tables with rows and columns (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL)
  - Non-relational Databases: NoSQL Databases, designed for unstructured or semi-structured data (e.g. MongoDB, Cassandra)
 
* Database Management Systems (DBMS) Overview
  DBMS :: a software :: for creation, management and querying of databases :: ensures data integrity, security and concurrency
  Examples: Oracle DB, Microsoft SQL Server

* SQL vs NoSQL Databases
  - SQL Databases: structured database, support ACID properties
 -  NoSQL Databases: offers schema flexibility, horizontal scalability, and are ideal for handling large scal unstructured data
